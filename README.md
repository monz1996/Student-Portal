# Student-Portal
Problem

Create a website for the university which can be used by the members of the university
students, TAS, Lecturers and so on.
It needed to include many many functionalities such as:
-Login and logout of the system.
-View and update Profile.

-Sign in and Sign out when entering and leaving the campus.
-View attendance records, missing/extra hours and missing/extra days.

IDEA

1- MODEL-Model class for each role in the university, Student, HR, TA, ETC.....
2- ROUTER- Router class for each model. The router has 3 main functionalities.
3- SERVER- Server class to start sending and receiving data to/from the user.
4- FETCHER- Fetcher classes which are responsible for the CRUD operations.
5- MONGODB- Connect the project to mongoDB to store all the data in.
6- UI- Create the UI of the website.
7- CONNECTION- Finally connect between the back-end and the front-end.

What I did in this project was create all the models, routers and
fetchers.

Implementation

For the model Implementation, I Created a class for each model, each class contained a
certain number of schemas, each schema was an object that contained variables that
defined it. So for example the Attendance Record Schema had a date, sign In, sign Out
and so on... as variables, some Schemas had classes in them and that was the
implementation in a nutshell, however it was not as easy as it sounds.

For the router implementation, I created a router class for each model, the router was
responsible for mainly 3 things, making sure that the user has the authority of the action
he/she is committing by checking the JAVA WEB TOKEN. For example if the person
needs to view student grades he needs to be a TA or a Lecturer. Make sure that the
action the person is taking is a valid action, for example if the HR wants to delete a
certain room from the system of the university but this location is currently occupied,
the router will not allow this action to happen. And finally make sure that the input from
the user is a valid one, letâ€™s say the lecturer wants to put more students in a lecture room
than the maximum capacity, the router will deny the request and send and error to the
user.

For the fetchers, I created a fetcher class for all the entities of the project which required
CRUD operations, for example Log In Fetcher was responsible for comparing the log

In information with the data in the server, it receives the encoded password and
username from the sever and compares them with the input after encoding it, and it is
also responsible for updating the log In time of the user. The HR Fetcher had an update
staff member functionality, the fetcher updates the server data accordingly.

.

Result

The project worked very well but it had an issue with calculating the correct salary
deduction for staff that had missed working hours, that was the only issue and I still
consider myself proud of this project because it was on a very very large scale and to
only come out with one mistake is a big accomplishment but of course I always aim to
deliver a flawless project every time.

Challenges

Creating the models, it was very challenging to create the models, because I had no
guidance while creating them, I needed to come up with the number of models, all the
variables and classes inside them and all the data types of all the variables to make the
project work properly and to deliver results that will fit in the required functionalities of
each model.

Different

-I created a model for the TAs and another for the lecturers which led to a lot of issues
while implementing the other classes, the right thing to do was to create one model
called ACADEMIC and inside it we add a variable called Job-title or Role
- also I would have put more effort into finding an algorithm that returns the correct
salary of all the staff of the university
